  abstract = {Encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger,
              and Signal provide secure and deniable communication for billions
              across the world, but these exact properties prevent holding users
              accountable for sending messages that are abusive, misinformative,
              or otherwise harmful to society. Previous works have addressed this
              concern by allowing a moderator to verify the identity of a
              message's sender if a message is reported; if not reported,
              messages maintain all security guarantees. Using primitives from
              threshold cryptography, this work extends the message-reporting
              protocol Hecate from Issa, Alhaddad, and Varia to a setting in
              which consensus among a group of moderators is required to reveal
              and verify the identity of a message's sender.},
