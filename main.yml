            mortality data to produce granular estimates of life expectancy by
            geography, income, race, and sex.
          - Conducted analyses to disentangle the mechanisms behind the
            diverging health of the rich and the poor.

        with: Nicholas Hopper

        bullets:
          - Designed a tool for reporting misuse on encrypted messaging
            platforms that provably maintains users' privacy.
          - Utilized threshold cryptography and a non-interactive
            zero-knowledge-proof to have senders of reported messages retain
            their privacy until their messages are reported many times or by
            many people.
          - Presented findings at 44th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy.

        bullets:
          - Proposed and studied a novel combinatorial problem inspired by
            clustering survey responses.
          - Proved NP-completeness and inapproximability under certain
            restrictions.
          - Demonstrated the existence of a greedy 0.5-approximation on a
            restricted case.

      - title: Research Assistant
        subtitle: LIGO Scientific Collaboration
        dates: January 2024 -- March 2024
        with: Jay Tasson

        bullets:
          - Served as a computational RA on a project searching for
            gravatational waves emitted by spinning neutron stars.
          # - Due to their slight asymmetry, theory predicts that the stars'
          #   rotation should emit regularly-spaced ripples in spacetime that
          #   appear as faint peaks in the signal's Fourier transform.
          - Helped build and maintain a database and interactive dashboard to
            locate and filter false positives from the collaboration's sensor
            data.
